# BBO

Educational project focused on online security of personal/sensitive information. You need to install the project to your local computer to run the app.

# Install Instructions

1. Download the project https://github.com/Big-Banking-Buddies/bbo/releases
2. Open the terminal and run "npm install" to get the dependencies.
3. Open another terminal and run "npm run database" to start the local database for the wishlist function (You may skip this if you don't want to use the Wishlist).
4. Run "npm start" to start the localhost.

# Developer Notes

This project is overall a good experience learning and practicing the secure development concepts from the class materials. All the teammates worked together and successfully made a web application that is more secure than our previous projects. Most of the designed functionalities have been integrated into the final version. Due to the time constraint and the lack of familiarity with the Remote database, some pages should be more completed than what we have for now.
